Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Practice Project
In this file, I tried to write the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using the Python programming language.
Of course, not just in the form of entering a few words!
I also prepared a menu for it to be displayed better in CMD format.
This exercise is a good exercise for those who are just starting out in Python programming to practice conditional functions and the Random library.
